Everything was working well with freeswitch service.
Then suddenly I could not start freeswitch service anymore as I got:

takeshi@takeshi-desktop:t1$ docker compose up freeswitch
[+] Running 2/2
 ✔ Network t1_default         Created                                                                                                                                             0.1s 
 ✔ Container t1-freeswitch-1  Created                                                                                                                                             0.3s 
Attaching to freeswitch-1
freeswitch-1  | Environment variables 'SOUND_RATES' or 'SOUND_TYPES' not defined. Skiping sound files checking.
freeswitch-1  | ERROR: Failed to set SCHED_FIFO scheduler (Operation not permitted)
freeswitch-1  | ERROR: Could not set nice level

and it would get stuck and freeswitch would not actually start.

This was solved by adding this to docker-compose.yml:
    cap_add:
      - SYS_NICE
